    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p>A little bit more about myself and my beginings.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2> Who am I?</h2>
      <p>I am a member of the Management Team at the Adidas Flagship Store in Barcelona while also pursuing my studies in Engineering at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB). With international experience in three countries—Spain, Portugal, and Japan——, I have honed my communication skills across diverse channels. Additionally, my educational journey in Computer Science and Electronics has provided me with a solid technical foundation in these fields. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, my background as an athlete has instilled in me the core values of teamwork, work ethic, discipline, and personal growth. These qualities, combined with my adaptability, organizational skills, and versatility, have shaped me into a diligent professional who excels at devising and implementing effective plans to navigate any situation or project successfully.</p>

    <h2> Early Life</h2>
        <p>Although I'm from Moroccan origin, I was born and initially raised in Spain. Born in the province of Barcelona, from a young age I was fluent in Spanish and Catalan, on top of studying English. Ever since I can remember, I have always loved football and have been fascinated on "machines" and how they worked. I loved seeing and helping my father fix things around the house, and as my talent in mathematics started to blossom from the beggining of my education, everybody around me saw what branch of studies I would follow.</p>
        <p>At the age of 5, the economic crisis in Spain forced my mother to immigrate and leave the country. My parents decided that it would be best if I followed my mother. So there it was: a 5 year old leaving for another country, another culture, another language... I felt like I lost my life. However, even if the color of my skin was different, and my economic level wasn't at the level of my collegues, a simple football match at my first break was enough to begin a friendship with some incredible people. Football, and later on my devotion to gymnastics facilitated my integration into a new society and a tough and demanding educational plan. Althoough I entered Portugal without will, at the age of 9 I left in tears and devestated, due to, again, the growing financial crisis. This time, though, we weren't leaving to a neighboring country: we were moving halfway across the world.</p>
        <p>After landing in Okinawa I saw that it had nothing to do with the rest of the Asian country. It was rustic, considerably dirty, and it was full of Americans. 40% of the Island was covered in American military bases, filling the island with cultural diversity. Once again, football was the bridge that created so many ever lasting friendships.</p>

        <p>At the age of 12, it was time to return to Spain. Readapting to your own culture, forging myself into who I am today, and choosing my paths in education, work and my personal life.</p>

    <h2> As a Student and Worker</h2>
      <p>As a Student I consider myself to be extremely hard working and devoted. I'm aware that I may not be the most talented in every aspect, and I'm certain that I know everything there is to know. However, I can assure that I'm always going to be the hardest working individual in the room. </p>
      <p>I'm always willing to learn from other people and from every situation. I have learned how to deal with my frustration, and now I excell in communicating with others and getting the best out of everyone and every situation. </p>

    <h2> As an Athlete</h2>
      <p>I've been playing football since I could walk. Barefoot in the street, in a packed staduim, and even in the beach. I have had the chance to play at the highest youth level, and have had the chance to display my talent around the world.</p>

      <p>My organized sports carrer started in gymnastics, though, as football was to expensive for my family and the gymnastics team was free to join. Although I had no big expectations, it really helped me develop and know my body, gaining a lot of strength and muscle. In addition, I also learned a lot of discipline and self control.</p>
      <p>After a tough injury in my left knee (MCL, ACL, and Meniscus) I decided to quit organized football, as I felt like I was no longer at my previous level and it was time to dedicate efforts to other aspects of life. I still play semi-organized football, and I enjoy it as a fan as well.</p>

    <h2> As a Person</h2>
      <p>Friendly, educated, and funny, but firm when necessary. I have very clear values that have been passed on by my family, and I will always live by them.</p>
